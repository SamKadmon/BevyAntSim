# Anthive Simulation:
✅︎ : Get a window to open
✅︎ : Render an entity
✅︎ : Have it move
✅︎ : Render multiple entities (distinguishable from player, maybe other ants or food?)
✅︎ : Give them a primitive movement behavior
✅︎ : Create Ant Spawner Entity
✅︎ : Give the Ant Spawner the ability to actually spawn Ants
✅︎ : Neuter its ability to Ants
✅︎ : Associate the Spawner's Children with it (Win Custody Battle against the World)
✅︎ : Give them a wander behavior
✅︎ : Implement Bounds
✅︎ : Slow down the fucking
✅︎ : Make a boundary sprite
✅︎ : CAMERA BONANZA 1: Get the camera to move around in the cardinal directions in 3D
✅︎ : CAMERA BONANZA 2: Get the camera to zoom correctly in 3D
✅︎ : CAMERA BONANZA 3: Get the camera to rotate around a point correctly in 3D
✅︎~: CAMERA BONANZA 4: Get the camera to pitch up and down correctly in 3D (limited to a hemisphere)
✅︎ : Rewrite the Antsim to be in 3D
   : Give them a sensory range (Naive minimum,)
   : Make Food functional
   : Make them approach food that is in their sensory radius
   : Make them consume the food, stopping their approach behavior
   : Make point light move (Emulate Sun)
   : Apply Pixel Fragment Shader
   : Create Movement Bundle
   : Refactor Code
   : Seperate Code out into more functions
